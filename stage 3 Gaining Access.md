Gaining Access
Once scanning and enumeration are complete, the next step in ethical hacking is Gaining Access. This is where an ethical hacker exploits vulnerabilities to breach the target system. 
The goal is to assess security weaknesses and demonstrate how attackers could compromise the system.

Techniques for Gaining Access
Exploiting Vulnerabilities Using known software vulnerabilities to gain access.
Tools: Metasploit, ExploitDB, SearchSploit

Password Attacks
Cracking weak passwords to gain access.Techniques: Brute Force, Dictionary Attacks, Credential Stuffing.
Tools: Hydra, John the Ripper, Hashcat

Social Engineering Attacks
Manipulating people into revealing credentials.Techniques: Phishing, Pretexting, Impersonation.
Tools: Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), Evilginx2

Exploiting Web Application Vulnerabilities
Attacking websites and web services to gain unauthorized access.Techniques: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), LFI/RFI.
Tools: SQLmap, Burp Suite, XSSer

 Privilege Escalation
 After gaining initial access, escalating privileges to gain full control.
 Techniques: Kernel exploits, Misconfigured SUID files, Weak permissions.
 Tools: Linux Exploit Suggester, Windows Exploit Suggester

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
Intercepting and manipulating network traffic.
Tools: Ettercap, Bettercap, ARPspoof
