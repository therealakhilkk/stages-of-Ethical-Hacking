Maintaining Access (Persistence)
After gaining access to a system, ethical hackers focus on maintaining access (persistence) to ensure they can return later without needing to exploit the system again. 
This phase is crucial for simulating real-world threats, as attackers often install backdoors, create hidden user accounts, or use rootkits to retain control.

Techniques for Maintaining Access
Creating Backdoors
Backdoors allow re-entry into a compromised system even after reboot.
Common methods:
 Using Netcat for a persistent reverse shell
 Creating a Metasploit backdoor
 Deploying a Webshell

 Creating Hidden User Accounts
 Attackers create new admin accounts to maintain access.

 Rootkits & Kernel Exploits
 Rootkits hide malware and processes from system monitoring tools.
 Tools: Chkrootkit, Rkhunter, Rootkit Hunte.
