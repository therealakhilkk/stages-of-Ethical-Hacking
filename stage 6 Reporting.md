Reporting and Remediation
After performing a penetration test, the most critical phase is Reporting & Remediation. 
A well-structured report helps organizations understand vulnerabilities, assess risks, and implement fixes.
Goals:
Document findings in a structured manner.
Explain exploited vulnerabilities with evidence.
Provide remediation steps to fix security gaps.
Ensure the organization can mitigate risks effectively.

Structure of an Ethical Hacking Report
A professional penetration testing report typically includes the following sections
Executive Summary (Non-Technical Overview)
A high-level overview for management and stakeholders.
Summarizes critical risks and their business impact.
No technical detailsâ€”just key takeaways.

 Methodology Used
 Explains the approach and tools used.
 References ethical hacking frameworks (OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK, PTES).

 Findings and Exploitation Details
 Each vulnerability is documented with:
 Vulnerability Name (e.g., SQL Injection, RCE)
 CVSS Score (Severity Level)
 Affected System/Endpoint
 Proof of Concept (PoC)
 Impact on Business

Remediation Recommendations
Fixing strategies for each vulnerability.
Best security practices to prevent future attacks.
 Example Remediation for SQL Injection:
 Use Prepared Statements & Parameterized Queries.
 Sanitize User Input.
 Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF).
