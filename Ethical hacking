Ethical hacking is the practice of testing computer systems, networks, and applications for security vulnerabilities in a lawful and controlled manner. 
Ethical hackers, also known as white-hat hackers, use the same techniques as malicious hackers but with the goal of improving security rather than exploiting weaknesses.

Ethical Hacking:
Penetration Testing: Simulating cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities.
Network Security Testing: Assessing firewall configurations, network architecture, and security policies.
Malware Analysis: Investigating malicious software to understand and mitigate threats.
Social Engineering: Testing human security awareness through phishing simulations and other tactics.
Compliance & Reporting: Ensuring organizations meet security standards and providing detailed reports on vulnerabilities.

Why Is Ethical Hacking Important?
To understand the importance of ethical hacking in the cyber security world, let’s look at some of its many applications. 
Ethical hacking can be used to
Test password strength
Penetration test after software updates or a new security patch
Test the validity of authentication protocols 
Ensure data communication channels cannot be intercepted

Deterring threats from malicious hackers is often a top priority of corporate, e-commerce, banking and financial systems operators who need to ensure customer data—like birthdays, payment information and passwords—are protected. Without this protection, successful cyberattacks can result in catastrophic results,—including loss of data, fines and other penalties, lost revenue and diminished consumer confidence.
As more aspects of our lives involve online transactions, the internal systems, software and servers required to make it all run smoothly remain vulnerable to cyberattacks. For this reason, institutions, such as those who handle sensitive electronic medical records, have made cyber security measures a vital component of their risk management strategies
