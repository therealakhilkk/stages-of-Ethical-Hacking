Scanning and Enumeration
Once reconnaissance is complete, the next step in ethical hacking is scanning and enumeration. 
This phase involves actively probing the target to gather more detailed information about its network, services, and vulnerabilities.
Identify live hosts, open ports, running services, and system details.
Detect potential vulnerabilities in networked devices.

Types of Scanning
Network Scanning – Identifies active devices and their IP addresses.
Port Scanning – Detects open ports and services on a system.
Vulnerability Scanning – Identifies security weaknesses in the system.

Types of Enumeration
 SNMP Enumeration – Retrieves system info using Simple Network Management Protocol.
 SMB Enumeration – Identifies shared resources and user details on Windows networks.
 LDAP Enumeration – Extracts directory services information.
 DNS Enumeration – Finds subdomains and records (A, MX, TXT).
 NetBIOS Enumeration – Extracts information from Windows-based systems.
